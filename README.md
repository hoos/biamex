Cloud Development
------------------

The Biamex source code is freely available via GitHub under the GPL V3 license.

We encourage developers to create an openshift account if they want to make use of the Biamex cloud facilties.

You can create an account at: http://www.openshift.com/

Once you have created and account you can send a request to join the core development team which will give you access to the cloud services.

You will need to identify your personal SSH Key via the openshift website and then you can checkout the code and begin developing.

```
cd workspace
git clone ssh://<YourSSHKey>@helloworldwebapp-biamex.rhcloud.com/~/git/helloworldwebapp.git/
```
